Premature atrial contractions or supraventricular ectopics are not harmful per se other than giving you symptoms.

Beta blocker is the safest option available, although not the most effective one and other options are ablation or antiarrhrythmics. So trying behavioral techniques is a good option. But if it troubles you a lot then you may request low dose antiarrhythmics like Amiodarone for a short period of time, but they may again come back after the drug is stopped. Since there is no atrial fibrillation or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmics are absolutely necessary, but the benefit would be in you is just symptomatic, which comes with the risk of side effects. However, you should have Holter at regular intervals like yearly (with echo for aortic regurgitation), or if you notice sustained ectopics or irregular rhythm implying development of fibrillation. You may discuss changing Atenolol to others like Metoprolol and see if its help. You should try to identify triggers like sleep or gastric disturbances, alcohol or smoking (if any), any particular medications (which you are on), stress, etc. Also, if not had recently, thyroid should be tested.

Little bit crowding is seen in both upper lateral incisors that might be the reason for you opting for braces. Well, as a specialist upper tooths have a little bit of space in between the central incisors. Upper front teeth need proximal slicing to facilitate space that space will be enough to realign your both upper lateral to the arch. Although it is just a front profile if possible upload a side profile of your face to evaluate the overjet but I can say just marginal and proximal slicing of the upper front teeth will be enough, and no further extraction needed. Meanwhile, you have missing both lower second premolars. Get a fixed bridge to cover the gaps or else they will shift and get malaligned.

The second is intestinal amebiasis which is a parasitic infection. Typhoid seems to be likely possibly given his almost 10 days of fever, and in second week, he started to develop abdominal pain which is suggestive of typhoid ulcers in small bowel. I would suggest him an antibiotic course for at least 10 days, and a maximum of 14 days which would cover both potential bugs. I also want that you get him some blood and stool tests before starting antibiotic course. The antibiotic course is relatively safe. I also want that you closely examine his chest for the development of rose spots. They are very small pinkish marks which develop among patient over the chest in the second week of the illness. Do not worry they are harmless, it is just a manifestation. I really hope his symptoms will improve like a fever would start settle, and abdominal pain should resolve in the next 48 to 72 hours of the start of the antibiotic regimen. I would also want to know the assessment/prescription of a previous doctor who said about colopathy. The colopathy is a very broad and vague term which means colon (large bowel) inflammation. It has a number of causes the one is painkillers (NSAIDs) and recently COVID 19 has shows some case reports with colopathy. But if your family and he himself does not have any contact history to COVID 19 positive or suspected case, then the possibility is very rare. Ultrasound is not a sensitive investigation for the disease which involves the bowel lumen such as in your husband's case. Ultrasound is more helpful in disease involving liver, spleen, or gall bladder. So it is not uncommon to have a normal ultrasound with conditions like typhoid fever or intestinal amebiasis. So I am writing him antibiotics for 10 days now if the improvement is shown we would increase up to 14 days. I really hope with this course his symptoms will start settling in the next 48 to 72 hours. And lastly, get some blood and stool tests as I suggest her and discuss the reports once they are available. Typhoid fever. Intestinal amebiasis. C. difficle infection. Colopathy. Complete blood count. Blood culture and sensitivity (before starting antibiotic course). IHA titer for E. Histolytica. Stool detail report and ova parasites. Stool for fecal calprotectin. Stool for C.difficle infection and stool for culture and Sensitivity (before starting antibiotic course). You can ask him to give sample today and start antibiotics just after giving the sample. Capsule Cefixime 400 mg twice daily for 10 days, tablet Flagyl 400 mg thrice daily for seven days (this antibiotic can cause metallic taste in mouth and or decreased appetite) for that you can give him tablet Levosulpiride 25 mg thrice daily half hour before meals for nausea, appetite.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Healthcare chatbot"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. From the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss. This is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible, one of them being genetic. If you have other family members with similar patterned hair loss the chances for you to develop it increase too. Due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle, over a period of time, the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily. Also, the growing phase of the hair is shortened, so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier. Being just 17 years old I am sure it must be worrying you a lot. But do not be disheartened. There are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss, thinning, and increasing regrowth. A combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with application of lotions containing Minoxidil 5% to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion. Oral Finasteride, which is the male hormone blocker, is used frequently. Applications with Finasteride are available too. This will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects, etc. Several preparations of bio-peptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract, melatonin, etc are also available to boost the hair growth. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is a popular procedure which is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further. Usually, a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation. But using the applications regularly is the key to good results.

Yes, it is nearly impossible to keep reduce weight and maintain diet and exercise. I may not be able to give you a composite plan of action for your weight reduction since it is not basically a one day consultation task. In fact, it is a long term commitment towards yourself and towards a multidisciplinary team inclusive of a dietician, bariatric endoscopist (gastroenterologist), behavioral therapist, and lastly a bariatric surgeon. So I would give you facts and figures for the existing evidence of weight reduction therapies. Remember your current body mass index BMI is 34.3. The goal of any weight reduction treatment is to reduce weight to optimal ranges where the physical and psychological well being of a person is maintained. Now anybody whose body mass index (BMI) is more than 40 should straight away consider bariatric intervention in the form of endoscopic or surgical modality. And anybody whose BMI is 35 but having other conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, coronary artery disease (heart disease) or lung dysfunction (lung hypertension and sleep disorders) should undergo interventions. But you see not all person fit into above category. Many have BMI less than 35 (such as in your case) and having very troubling symptoms, among such people individualized approach is employed whether medicinal use or endoscopic or surgical intervention. Diets and regular weight reduction exercises do help to reduce weight by 7 to 10%. All medicines which are currently in use help reduce weight by 10 to 20%. Certain endoscopic bariatric procedures such as balloon placement in stomach and sleeve gastrectomy does help reduce weight around 25% And lastly, surgical procedures such as metallic rings around the stomach via laparoscopy and surgical sleeve gastrectomy, and surgical Roux Y bypass, help to reduce weight by 30 to 35%. The figures are ranges, they vary significantly in individual cases. I also want you to understand, that these interventions should be accompanied with optimal dieting and exercise even after surgery or medicinal therapy. Otherwise, the weight can frequently recur to original ones. This above description is only to make you understand and figure out things. I can recommend you to start with dieting (keeping your calories well below 1500 Kcal daily), running, swimming, and weight lifting on a regular basis. I also suggest you to meet a dietician on icliniq or otherwise in person, to get a diet plan with respect to your calorie requirement. I can suggest you some medicinal treatment, but they are prescription medicine, may not be OTC, and the course has to be taken for at least six months to see the effect. Naltrexone/Bupropion (Contrave) is proven and FDA approved and can be started in your case. But I want you to provide more information about your health, as I can assess your condition first and treat aimfully rather adding more harm to your health. Because these medications have some side effects and they should be kept in mind before giving it therapeutically. I also want to know about family support, any occupational therapist available near your vicinity, your current job status, and medical health insurance, and also information whether the cost of these medicines is covered or not. Until that time you follow up, I want you to get the following blood tests to better know the impact of your obesity on bodily systems. I hope this helps. Obesity. Complete blood count. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3, FT4. Liver function test. Fasting lipid profile. Serum CRP (C-reactive protein). Albumin total protein and AG ratio. Arterial blood gases.

Around the first week of March, I went to see an opthalmologist who told me I had a bacterial infection of both eyes. I was prescribed Vigamox and after seven days my eyes were fine. Due to quarantine, I was not able to go back to my doctor. Around the last week of April, I had the same symptoms and since I cannot go out I treated my eyes with Vigamox again and was healed after seven days. After that from time to time, I have swelling, not much but mostly in the morning. I am a 68-year-old female. I have allergies, seafood, pollen, and dust. I take Allerta or Claritin from time to time to relieve my allergies. I smoke but I am trying to quit, before 6 to 10 sticks, now reduced to four or five."}]}

I understand your concern here and you are right that there are not many or in fact hardly any articles or peer-reviewed papers on Melatonin and birth control interactions. But I would like to keep it simple for you to understand. Melatonin is produced during the night to ease the sleep pattern in humans post-sunset with maximum levels at 9 PM and by morning 9 AM, the levels found are almost negligible. So, it is produced by the pineal gland in the dark cycle and metabolized at night by the liver. Now liver also is known to metabolize the birth control pills be it progesterone-only or combinations pills. Hence, if taken together then there is a likelihood of slower metabolism of either compound and thereby prolonged residual effect may be seen on concurrent use of pills and Melatonin together. The effects could be prolonged sleepiness and also Melatonin induced increased progesterone levels in the body causing bloating and noticeable progestogenic side effects. However, the efficacy or effectiveness of the pill is not compromised but metabolism is delayed as Melatonin competes with the pill with the liver. So ideally the better way would be to switch the POP in the morning hours and the Melatonin pill at night 12 hours apart. This would prevent any interference with either action on the body or cause any interaction.  "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello doctor, I have read that Melatonin could possibly lessen the effectiveness of birth control pills.

I am looking for a doctor to weigh in on this issue."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Healthcare chatbot"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello. It is important in your case to rule out the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease. Now points in favor are history of chlamydia and UTI in the past, pain on deep penetration and tenderness on the left side of abdomen. These are the sufficient point to evaluate for the possibility of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). I guess you do not have any discharge per vaginum may be scanty. One more thing is, just try to see if you are having this pain from the beginning from the intercourse or started after some time. Because if it is from the beginning then this may be dyspareunia and not related to PID. But if it has developed later then it becomes important that you undergo evaluation for PID. You will need an ultrasound of pelvis, CRP (C-reactive protein) or ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), vaginal fluid smear. However, the vaginal examination will also be helpful to see whether there is any cervical motion tenderness, which would give a fair idea about the possibility. It is important to rule out PID because it can have consequences later like fertility issues. So if we get any clues regarding it then you will need a course of antibiotic treatment. I hope this helps.  "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello doctor, I only have one sexual partner for almost a year.
